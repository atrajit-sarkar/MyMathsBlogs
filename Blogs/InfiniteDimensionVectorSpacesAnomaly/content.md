In the context of **\( C^0 \)** (which I assume refers to a vector space with continuous functions or a sequence space) and its subspace, if we are discussing these as **infinite-dimensional spaces**, the situation becomes more nuanced.

If we have:

- \( C^0 \) with basis \( \{e_1, e_2, \dots \} \)
- A subspace with basis \( \{e_2, e_3, \dots \} \)

Then, **yes**, these two spaces **can be linearly isomorphic** in certain cases, but with an important distinction. Let me break it down:

### Infinite-Dimensional Spaces:

In infinite-dimensional spaces like \( C^0 \) (if we're considering spaces of functions or sequences), there is no limitation that the dimensions must be finite. The idea of a basis extends to countable sets in these contexts. In such a case:

- The space \( C^0 \), with the basis \( \{e_1, e_2, \dots \} \), would be infinite-dimensional.
- The subspace with basis \( \{e_2, e_3, \dots \} \) is also infinite-dimensional.

Although the subspace is missing the element \( e_1 \), in infinite-dimensional spaces, a **countable set of linearly independent vectors** can still span a subspace that has the same cardinality (dimension) as the original space. Thus, even though the subspace starts at \( e_2 \) instead of \( e_1 \), the **dimension** of both the space and the subspace is still infinite and the same, so a **linear isomorphism** can be constructed between the two.

### How isomorphism works here:

- You can define a linear map from the subspace (with basis \( \{e_2, e_3, \dots \} \)) to the larger space (with basis \( \{e_1, e_2, \dots \} \)) by defining the image of each basis element \( e_n \) in the subspace to be \( e_{n+1} \) in the larger space. This is a bijection (one-to-one and onto) that preserves linearity, so it is a linear isomorphism.

### Conclusion:

For **infinite-dimensional spaces** like \( C^0 \), **the space and its subspace are linearly isomorphic**. This is because both spaces are infinite-dimensional and have the same cardinality of dimension, even though the subspace lacks the \( e_1 \) vector.
