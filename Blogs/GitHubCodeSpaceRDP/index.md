### **üí° Step-by-Step Process to Set Up RDP in Codespace**
---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Install and Start XRDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)**
When you create a new Codespace, you need to install and configure `xrdp` to allow remote desktop connections.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y xrdp xfce4 xfce4-goodies firefox
```
- `xrdp` ‚Üí Enables **RDP access**
- `xfce4 xfce4-goodies` ‚Üí **Lightweight desktop environment**
- `firefox` ‚Üí Web browser

#### **Start & Enable XRDP**
```bash
sudo service xrdp start
```
#### Check XRDP is running
```bash
sudo service xrdp status
```

#### Set admin password
```bash
sudo passwd codespace
```

#### Auto-start xRDP on Container Restart
GitHub Codespaces does not persist services across restarts by default. To ensure xrdp starts automatically, add this to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`:
```bash
echo "sudo service xrdp start" >> ~/.bashrc
```
Then Apply changes
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
- Ensures XRDP **starts automatically** on reboot.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up the Desktop Environment for RDP**
- XRDP doesn‚Äôt start a desktop automatically, so we need to configure it.

Edit **startwm.sh** to use XFCE:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh
```
Replace **everything inside** with:
```bash
#!/bin/sh
unset DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
unset XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
startxfce4
```
**Save and exit** (`CTRL+X`, then `Y`, then `ENTER`).

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Restart XRDP & Allow Remote Connections**
```bash
sudo service xrdp restart
```

#### Configure your local machine
1. Now first of all we have to install [Git CLI](https://cli.github.com/)
2. Login to your github account where you have your codespace by
  ```bash
  gh auth login -s codespace
  ```
  follow on screen instructions set access to ssh and create ssh key and passphrase and then run the command to see list of running codespaces in your account:
  ```bash
  gh codespace list
  ```
  Then copy the name of of your codespace and connect it by the command:
  ```bash
  gh codespace ssh -c yourcodespacename -- -L 3389:localhost:3389
  ```
  That's it it will connect to your codespace via terminal and expose it to the localhost for rdp client to connect it.

### **Understanding the Command**
```sh
gh codespace ssh -c cuddly-dollop-975pwq6vjjvwfxj7g -- -L 3389:localhost:3389
```
This command does **SSH port forwarding (local tunneling)** from a **GitHub Codespace** to your **local machine**. Let's break it down:

---

### **Breaking Down the Command**
1. **`gh codespace ssh`**  
   - This is the GitHub CLI command to SSH into a Codespace.
   
2. **`-c cuddly-dollop-975pwq6vjjvwfxj7g`**  
   - Specifies the Codespace **name/ID** you want to connect to.

3. **`-- -L 3389:localhost:3389`**  
   - This part is a standard **SSH local port forwarding** command.

   - **`-L 3389:localhost:3389`** means:
     - Forward **port 3389** (used for RDP) **from the remote Codespace to your local machine**.
     - In simpler terms: **"Make my local machine act like the remote machine for RDP traffic."**

---

### **How This Works**
1. When you run this command, an SSH tunnel is created between your **local machine** and the **Codespace**.
2. The tunnel maps **port 3389 (RDP port) on your local machine** to **port 3389 on the Codespace**.
3. You can then use **Microsoft Remote Desktop (RDP)** on your local machine and connect to **`localhost:3389`**.
4. Even though you are connecting to "localhost," it actually redirects to the Codespace through the SSH tunnel.

### **Comparison with AWS RDP**
| Feature           | **GitHub Codespaces (with SSH Tunnel)** | **AWS RDP (Traditional VPS RDP)** |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Access Method**  | SSH tunnel with port forwarding    | Direct RDP connection to public IP |
| **Security**      | Secure (SSH encryption, no direct exposure) | Less secure if RDP port is open to public |
| **Network Exposure** | Only accessible via SSH (localhost) | Exposed to the internet (unless restricted) |
| **Performance**   | Slower due to tunneling overhead | Faster, direct connection |
| **Flexibility**   | Needs SSH to be running | Direct access anytime |
| **Use Case**      | Temporary development access | Full-time RDP for VPS hosting |

---

### **Key Differences**
- In **AWS**, you connect **directly to the public IP** of the server via RDP.
- In **Codespaces**, you **must first create an SSH tunnel**, then connect **through localhost**.
- AWS RDP **exposes the server to the internet**, making it riskier if not properly secured.
- Codespaces **keeps the server hidden**, requiring SSH authentication first.

---

### **Conclusion**
- If you use **GitHub Codespaces**, you must **first set up the SSH tunnel**, then connect via `localhost:3389`.  
- In **AWS RDP**, you just **connect directly to the public IP** (if allowed).  
- Codespaces is **more secure** but slightly more complex to access.
