# My Coding Blog

Welcome to my coding blog! In this post, I'll share a simple code example to get you started with programming.

## Hello World in Python

Let's start with a classic "Hello, World!" program in Python. This is a simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

```python
# This is a simple Python program to print "Hello, World!"
print("Hello, World!")
```

### Explanation

- `print("Hello, World!")`: This line of code prints the text "Hello, World!" to the console.

## Running the Code

To run this code, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Open a text editor and copy the code above into a new file.
3. Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `hello_world.py`.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
5. Run the following command:

```sh
python hello_world.py
```

You should see the output:

```
Hello, World!
```

That's it! You've just written and executed your first Python program.
